### "Understanding and countering misinformation about climate change John Cook, George Mason University, USA" 

#### ABSTRACT
`While there is overwhelming scientific agreement on climate change, the public have become polarized over fundamental questions such as human-caused global warming. Communication strategies to reduce polarization rarely address the underlying cause: ideologically-driven misinformation disseminated through outlets such as social and mainstream media. In order to effectively counter online misinformation, we require foundational frameworks that provide comprehensive understanding of the techniques employed in climate misinformation, as well as inform evidence-based approaches to neutralizing misinforming content. This chapter reviews analyses of climate misinformation, outlining a range of denialist arguments and fallacies. Identifying and deconstructing these different types of arguments is necessary to design appropriate interventions that effectively neutralize the misinformation. 
This chapter also reviews research into how to counter misinformation using communication interventions such as inoculation, educational approaches such as misconception-based learning, and the interdisciplinary combination of technology and psychology known as technocognition.`

#### Themes and Ideas:
- Plugins that you can download in your browser that tell you what is credible or not
- Algorithms in social media platforms that tell what stories are true or not true
- 'Our Verdict' on false image, misinformation etc. classify the verdict
- More that people are aware the better
- Fact check claim unsure of (ie. google Climate Misinformation fact check)
- False images
- 'Very easy to spread misinformation to millions of people so rapidly'
- Journalists can be victims of misinformation
- When overwhelmed by information, scared or anxious, we do not process complexity well making us more susceptible to bad information
- Validate the source to decide 'trust'
