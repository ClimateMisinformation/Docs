## Problem statement 

> Most people accept climate change is real, however they personally don't take any action to make a difference.
 

### Quick start

[Research from Slack](Research_from_Slack.md) Our [slack channel](https://aiforgoodcommunity.slack.com/archives/C01B378SZN1) contains research we have collected. A selection of it is described here.

[MarketResearch](MarketResearch.md) Here we  summarise the problem we  want to solve, the reasons for climate mis-information, the types of  climate misinformation,how is climate misinformation spread and how it can be countered.

[Product canvas](ProductCanvas.md) The product team made an in depth analysis of the need for product we could build.
 
[Personas and the product ](Personas.md) Here  we describe expected users of a climate mis-information tool and their possible motivations  for using our tool.

[Assumption validation](https://github.com/ClimateMisinformation/Documentation/issues)
Our assumptions are described in the issues log. Reviewing them is a useful task for new contributers. 

[Keywords for scraping Twitter dataset](ClimateChangeTweets.md)

[Labelled data from scraping](LabelledDataFromArticleScrape.md)
We used our [scraping tools](https://github.com/ClimateMisinformation/Scrapers)  to scrape the websites described [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_pv0cFsYCdrJFp8M-Tc_Vbk221PvhtnCe-QaBr8rQw/edit?usp=sharing).
The articles were labelled by our team using a [docanno](https://doccano.herokuapp.com/) instance running on the cloud.  The project and labels were exported [here](labelled_data/doccano). They  cam be imported into other doccano instances.
