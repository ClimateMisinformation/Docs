Themes and Ideas:

- Facts alone do not help the public understand social problems or drive them to take action.
- But facts do matter if framed well
- Balance an explanation of the problem with solutions-oriented discussions.
- Communications that explain why social or scientific phenomena matter, how they work, and what needs to be done to address them.
- Appealing to certain values—cultural beliefs and ideals—encourages people to think about social problems in new and productive ways.
