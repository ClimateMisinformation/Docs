Themes and Ideas:

- Plugins that you can download in your browser that tell you what is credible or not
- Algorithms in social media platforms that tell what stories are true or not true
- 'Our Verdict' on false image, misinformation etc. classify the verdict
- More that people are aware the better
- Fact check claim unsure of (ie. google Climate Misinformation fact check)
- False images
- 'Very easy to spread misinformation to millions of people so rapidly'
- Journalists can be victims of misinformation
- When overwhelmed by information, scared or anxious, we do not process complexity well making us more susceptible to bad information
- Validate the source to decide 'trust'
